# tag-adder
A web program used to add tags to the tag index.

# How To Use
When the program starts, it will create a pseudo-copy of the current Tag Index.

To add tags, enter in the information for your tag in the "Generate Tag" box.

- Group: Should be the group the tag belongs to (genre, themes, aesthetic, etc)
- Name: The name of the tag
- Description: A description of what the tag applies to.

After that, click generate. The Tag will then be added to your instance of Tag Index which is the very bottom textarea.

Keep adding tags until you're done. To save it to the repository, copy your Tag Index and commit the real Tag Index with it on Github.
